In order to minimize the overlap in our content, we are going to simplify the structure of our content.

There are currently excercises as part of the Training which will be removed. Instead, they will point to a revamped section Hands-On section that will contain the following Excercises:

* Config
* Static Module Creation
  - Basic example
  - Bonus Question
* Dynamic Module Creation
  - Basic Example
  - Bonus Question

These exercises will point to sections in the DevGuide for further background in specific concepts.

The articles and other presentations can be on specific topics (that may or not be covered within the DevGuide), but will point to the "basic" presentations if possible.
