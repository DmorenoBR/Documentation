**Note: No comment in this guide is legal advice.**

DCAF is an open-source project, the core of which is licensed under Apache 2.0. The high-level details and requirements of how to contribute with DCAF can be found on the article Collaborating on the Development of DCAF.

To get involved with DCAF, visit the DCAF community in the National Instruments website, this is where you can have discussions with other members of the community. To more directly collaborate with the DCAF project by posting issues, recommending changes to the source code, or even uploading your own modules you can go to the Github pages. All of the source code is posted in this page with a separate repository for each individual module. Each of those modules is built into a VI Package and is posted on the LabVIEW tools Network.

The central repository is the DCAF-Core which is mostly a shell that points to the autobuild files. The actual implementation of the codebase is within the TagEditorCore where you can report issues. Note that to learn more about DCAF itself or if you are not sure if something is a bug, please go to the community instead.
